## Overview
Gemify is an end-to-end project that leverages the power of Google Gemini, a next-generation AI model that can understand and generate text, images, audio, video, and code across different domains.

Gemify is a web application that allows you to create amazing content based on your image and text inputs. You can upload any image of your choice and write a text prompt that describes what kind of content you want to generate. For example, you can upload a picture of a sunset and write "a poem about the beauty of nature". Gemify will then use Google Gemini to generate a relevant and creative poem that matches your image and text.

You can also download your generated content by clicking the download button. Gemify is a fun and easy way to explore the possibilities of multimodal AI and unleash your creativity.


## How to use Gemify

- Visit the Gemify website and click on the upload button to select an image from your device.
- Write a text prompt in the Input text field. The text prompt should be clear and descriptive of the kind of content you want to generate. For example, "a short story about a superhero", "a song about love", "a code snippet for a calculator", etc.
- Click on the "tell me" button and wait for a few seconds. Gemify will use Google Gemini to create a unique content that matches your image and text.
- Enjoy your generated content and download it if you like.


## Future work

Gemify is still a work in progress and there are many ways to improve and extend it. Some of the possible future work are:

- Adding more options and features for users to customize and fine-tune their content generation. For example, users can choose the style, tone, genre, length, and language of their content.
- Integrating more modalities and domains for content generation. For example, users can generate video from text, audio from images, code from audio, and so on.
- Improving the user interface and user experience of the web application.
